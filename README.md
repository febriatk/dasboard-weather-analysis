## Objectives
- To standardize and process raw weather data with inconsistent time intervals
- To visualize temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns across January 2022
- To identify signs of seasonal transition based on weather metrics


## Tools & Methods
- Python (Pandas) – For cleaning and resampling weather records from minute-based to hourly intervals
- Tableau – For building an interactive dashboard with daily weather indicators (e.g., temperature, rainfall, wind)
- Data Source – Weather data collected from BMKG Banyuwangi (via internship project)


## Key Insights
- Clear weather dominated January 2022, though rainfall still occurred frequently.
- The alternating pattern between rain and clear skies may suggest a transition from the rainy season to the dry season.
- Further analysis with additional months (e.g., December 2022 and February 2023) is recommended to validate this trend.
